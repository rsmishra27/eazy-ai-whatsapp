you enter in using the same glasses.We also have another IMAX clip-on glasses whose polarization is 0/90. Enter into 
our storefront and find the one suit for you.Benefits of Linear PolarizationThe process of linear polarization allows for lower light-loss than the process of circular polarization. Simply put, all things being equal with bulb
    brightness, screen, and throw distance, IMAX 3D is brighter than circular-polarization 3D systems. The brightness of image for a 3D film is a common
    complaint and almost all 3D systems suffer from significant light loss compared to 2D projection. This is an important factor for IMAX using Linear
    Polarized 3D Glasses, as they aim for premium audiovisual presentation.Benefits of Circular PolarizationIf you tilt your head at all, linear-polarization cross-talk will drastically increase. You'll start to see combined images in each eye, ruining the 3D
    effect and potentially giving you a headache. The same problem occurs with circular-polarization, but at a much lesser degree. Supporters of
    linear-polarization believe that most people will immediately get that something is wrong when they tilt their head, and will adjust back to an optimal
    viewing position. However, this makes a big assumption about how viewers will react to a suboptimal image and also places restrictions on the viewer that
    might lead to physical discomfort while watching a long film.

For those occasions when you can't zoom out far enough, you can switch to panorama mode and capture that sweeping landscape or get the whole group. To ensure that you always know what your image will look like, the C750 uses a real-image viewfinder that works no matter what print format (C, H, or P) you're using. The handy midroll change feature lets you switch film cartridges at any time. This lets you share your camera, but keep your film separate; you can also switch between black-and-white and color film or organize your images by theme.The C750 flip-up flash sits up far enough from the lens to help reduce the unsightly red-eye effect often caused by flash photography. The C750 automatically adjusts its flash settings, including close-up flash and fill-flash, to give you realistic results under all lighting situations. Even if your main subject is off-center, the wide-area sensor and smart multispot autofocus system detect it and bring the subject into sharp focus. Kodak includes the APS magnetic information exchange system to record the data from each scene. This data is recorded on your film's magnetic strip to help your local photo lab optimize the lighting and color of your prints.To protect your exposed film, the C750 has a safety interlock film door that won't open until it senses your film is completely wound back in the protective cartridge. This camera also looks after your battery power by turning itself off after 150 second of non-use.

To ensure that you always know what your image will look like, the C750 uses a real-image viewfinder that works no matter what print format (C, H, or P) you're using. The handy midroll change feature lets you switch film cartridges at any time. This lets you share your camera, but keep your film separate; you can also switch between black-and-white and color film or organize your images by theme.The C750 flip-up flash sits up far enough from the lens to help reduce the unsightly red-eye effect often caused by flash photography. The C750 automatically adjusts its flash settings, including close-up flash and fill-flash, to give you realistic results under all lighting situations. Even if your main subject is off-center, the wide-area sensor and smart multispot autofocus system detect it and bring the subject into sharp focus. Kodak includes the APS magnetic information exchange system to record the data from each scene. This data is recorded on your film's magnetic strip to help your local photo lab optimize the lighting and color of your prints.To protect your exposed film, the C750 has a safety interlock film door that won't open until it senses your film is completely wound back in the protective cartridge. This camera also looks after your battery power by turning itself off after 150 second of non-use. You can also include the date and one of 41 messages, in 12 languages, on the back of each print.

The Canon Elph Sport camera integrates Elph's crowd-pleasing Advanced Photo System ease of use and portability with a sporty waterproof body. Not only does it take pictures on land at the touch of a button, but it is submersible to 16.4 feet for underwater photography.

The Elph Sport easily fills both roles, offering signature Canon quality along with special features designed to make underwater shooting easier.The Elph Sport features an extra large viewfinder that enables you to frame your shots even with dive goggles on. A special meniscus lens and underwater macro setting account for water's refractive properties and ensure crisp shots. Larger-format controls allow you to operate the Canon Elph Sport even when wearing gloves. Another highlight of this camera is the anticondensation feature that prevents your lens from fogging up in extreme temperatures or moist climates.

&#x2666; 2) Zeikos 3-Piece Multi-Coated Glass Filter Kit (58mm UV/FLD/CPL)
&#x2666; 3) DIGI TECH Professional 5 Piece Cleaning Kit

The Zeikos 58mm Universal Professional Tulip Lens Hood is primarily designed to prevent unwanted stray light (flare) from entering the lens by extending and shading the end of the lens. In addition, since the end of the lens is extended, you also get the added benefit of some extra protection from accidental impact. Screw-mount lens hoods, such as this 58mm, are designed to screw right into your lens or filter. Rear locking ring allows the user to rotate the hood in 360direction.

Zeikos lens filters are translucent glass placed in front of a camera lens to alter or adjust the light entering the camera and to protect the camera lens. Lens filters improve photographs by giving photographers control over light and allowing them to emphasize the features of a scene that they consider most important. This filter kit includes 1 each of UV, Circular Polarizing and FLD filters. A UV filter is used to reduce UV rays from entering the lens; polarizers reduce glare from water, glass, or any non-metallic surface; FLD filters yield pleasing skin tones and correct color while shooting without a flash under fluorescent lighting.

This 6-piece cleaning kit contains everything you'll ever need to properly clean your lenses, including a Hurricane Air Blower, Lens Cleaning Tissues, Lens Cloth, Lens Cleaning Liquid, Brush and Cotton Swabs.","[['Electronics', 'Camera & Photo', 'Accessories', 'Digital Camera Accessories', 'Accessory Kits']]","Pro EW-60C 58mm Hard Lens Hood &amp; 3 (UV/FLD/CPL) Filter Set for Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Zoom Lens (with EOS 50D, 7D, Rebel XSi, XS, T1i, T2i Digital SLR Camera)",45.46,,,Digi,Accessory Kits,"Pro EW-60C 58mm Hard Lens Hood &amp; 3 (UV/FLD/CPL) Filter Set for Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Zoom Lens (with EOS 50D, 7D, Rebel XSi, XS, T1i, T2i Digital SLR Camera) Kit includes:

Zeikos lens filters are translucent glass placed in front of a camera lens to alter or adjust the light entering the camera and to protect the camera lens. Lens filters improve photographs by giving photographers control over light and allowing them to emphasize the features of a scene that they consider most important. This filter kit includes 1 each of UV, Circular Polarizing and FLD filters. A UV filter is used to reduce UV rays from entering the lens; polarizers reduce glare from water, glass, or any non-metallic surface; FLD filters yield pleasing skin tones and correct color while shooting without a flash under fluorescent lighting.

This 6-piece cleaning kit contains everything you'll ever need to properly clean your lenses, including a Hurricane Air Blower, Lens Cleaning Tissues, Lens Cloth, Lens Cleaning Liquid, Brush and Cotton Swabs. Accessory Kits"

Sticky Filters are a little more sticky than a 3M Post-It note and are used to correct for the strange background colorcast of photos taken when using a flash - empowering you, the photographer, over the final ""look"" of your photos. Today's computerized exposure control systems balance fill flash exposure with ambient light exposure very evenly, giving rise to a mixed color temperature in the photographs.

Digital cameras have the unique ability to correct for these various lighting conditions by using a feature called ""Auto White Balance"". But only if you don't use the flash!

ASA's electronic flight computer takes advantage of advances in display and microcomputer technologies for better performance and price. A menu of 34 functions gives users access to 40 aviation calculations, including weight and balance, with these features:

-May be used for FAA and Canadian Exams
--Users may bring the CX-2 with them to the testing centers for all pilot, mechanic, dispatcher, and FAA exams.

-Numerous Aviation Functions
--Calculate true airspeed, ground speed, mach number, altitudes, fuel, headings and courses, time/speed/distance, winds, headwind/crosswind components, gliding information, and weight and balance.

-Ergonomic Design
--The CX-2 features a simple keyboard and slim design. The hard-plastic carrying case protects the computer inside the flight bag, and fits on the back of the unit for storage while the computer is in use.

-Interactive Functions

No Sound Storm Laboratories amplifier series has been more influential, affected more of the masses, or given the user more control over their audio individuality than FORCE. For nearly a decade, SSL has been designing an array of FORCE amplifiers that pleases the senses. The one ohm stable F2600D, the 2,600 watt member of the FORCE class D monoblock family provides flexibility by allowing you to strap two amps together for TWICE the power (2 ohm stable). This amplifier features a low pass filter variable from 50Hz to 150Hz, a subsonic filter variable from 15Hz to 40Hz, and Bass Boost variable from zero to +18dB. It also boasts an input sensitivity selector, variable input gain control, power and protection (thermal, overload, and short circuit) LED indicators, and allows you to shift the phase 180 degrees. Other standard features on this model include RCA line level inputs, RCA line outputs for system building, chrome plated RCA connectors and screw terminals, and a remote subwoofer level control knob.

Questions and Answers
Q. Will this device convert Dolby Digital?
A. NO it will not convert Dolby Digital but on a lot of products you can change the settings. Let me explain. The most common problem we have seen is a change in setting on your device your trying to decode.

Bendi is a flexible mounting device that eliminates all those problems, keeping your nano in the perfect place to view and operate.Bendi is ideal for iPod nano 6G users with newer-model cars or aftermarket stereos which feature 3.5mm auxiliary audio inputs. Bendi's unique design is meant to integrate seamlessly with the neutral grays, browns, beiges, and blacks of the vast majority of car interiors. More an extension of your center console than an untidy audio cable, Bendi is just the right size and shape, visually complementing your iPod nano device and mounting it in an intuitive, easy-to-use position.Every detail of Bendi has been carefully engineered so you can enjoy the most in convenience and audio quality from your music. Jacks feature an inverted cone-shaped grip, making Bendi easy to insert and remove on both ends. And Bendi features gold-plated connectors for improved conductivity and an optimal stereo sound experience.Two Bendi connector mounts come in each package, giving you options for your audio setup regardless of where exactly your 3.5mm auxiliary jack is located. A larger cable measures 6.7 Inches (160mm) and a smaller cable measures 5.12 Inches (130mm) in length. Use the second connector for the other car in your family, or use it with your home stereo.

 The well labeled, large keypad provides user friendly operation. The large display
 shows both letters and numbers and is easy to see, making for fast frequency recognition.
 The display is backlit, and so is the keypad. The light stays on until you turn
 it off &ndash; a very handy feature for flying at night.""Flip-flop"" channel recallThe IC-A24 stores the last 10 channels used. You can easily recall
 those channels by pushing the ""flip-flop""
 recall buttons on the front panel. It is convenient for switching between several
 channels, such as NAV and COM channels.VOR navigationThe IC-A24 has VOR navigation functions. The DVOR mode shows the radial to or from
 a VOR station and the CDI mode shows the course deviation to/from a VOR station.
 You can also input your intended radial to/from the VOR station and show the course
 deviation on the display. In the USA version, the duplex operation allows you to
 call a COM channel, while you are using VOR navigation.External DC power jackAn external DC power jack allows for operation with the wall charger, BC-110 or
 the cigarette lighter cable, CP-20. When the battery pack is installed, simultaneous
 charging during operation is also possible. In addition, an optional battery case,
 BP-208N, is available.Water resistant constructionThe water resistant construction provides reliable operation in wet conditions.* Equivalent to IPX4 of the corresponding international standard
